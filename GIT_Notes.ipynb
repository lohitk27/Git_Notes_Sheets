If you‘re tempted to commit just because you need a clean working copy (to check out a branch, pull in changes, etc.)\n",

    "Use the imperative, present tense («change», not «changed» or «changes») to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.VERSION CONTROL IS NOT A BACKUP SYSTEM Having your files backed up on a remote server is a nice side effect of having a version control system. But you should not use your VCS like it was a backup system. When doing version control, you should pay attention to committing semantically (see «related changes») - you shouldn‘t just cram in files.\n",
    "USE BRANCHES\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching is one of Git‘s most powerful features - and this is not by accident: quick and easy branching was a central requirement from day one. Branches are the perfect tool to help you avoid mixing up different lines of development. You should use branches extensively in your development workflows: for new features, bug fixes, ideas… AGREE ON A WORKFLOW\n",
    "Git lets you pick from a lot of different workflows: long-running branches, topic branches, merge or rebase, git-flow… Which one\n",
    "you choose depends on a couple of factors: your project, your overall development and deployment workflows and (maybe most importantly) on your and your teammates‘ personal preferences. However you choose to work, just make sure to agree on a common\n",
